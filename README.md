I am a Node.js Developer from Philippines, mostly i create alot of Discord Bots! and this is an [example](https://top.gg/bot/773860431978168320) of one my creation as a Discotd bot Developer. I started learning how to code because i find it interesting and funa and that was a year ago when i was still 12 Years old! I am also learning HTML & CSS so i can create a personal website, i enjoy creating chatbots because they can be useful sometimes.

   I am looking forward to learn more languages in the future!
